1.  Make profiling work 
    - look for optimizations to be done based on output 
2.  Setup performance measurements and ability to run multiple times
3.  Use array allocation instead of allocating on stack 
4.  Figure out how to verify that it works 
    - use 5 seed configurations and use them also on the net versin of GOL
